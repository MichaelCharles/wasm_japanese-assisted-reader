# Japanese Assisted Reader (With Go and Web Assembly)

[See it on Github pages.](https://mcaubrey.github.io/wasm_japanese-assisted-reader)

## Run it locally.

The fastest way to get up and running is to use the [vercel/serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) package on NPM. This will spin up a simple web server which will statically host the project's files.

```
npx serve
```

## Build changes.

A Makefile is provided with a build command.

```
make build
```
